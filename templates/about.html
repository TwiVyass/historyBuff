                Welcome to <b>HauteBot</b> — your conversational co-creator for fashion ideas, references, and design inspiration.
                <br>
                This project was born from a simple need: to help fashion students and design enthusiasts get quick, reliable answers — especially when they don’t have easy access to mentors, libraries, or endless time to scroll through search results. <br><br> Whether you’re stuck on a historical detail, a silhouette, or just need a spark of creativity, HauteBot is here to help you move forward.
                <br>
                It’s not just about automation — it’s about <b>assistance</b>. Think of HauteBot as a chat companion trained in the language of fashion, built to help you brainstorm, explore, and experiment faster.<br>
                <br>
                While some AI tools generate images, we’ve chosen not to — out of respect for human creativity and the artists behind original work.<br><br> Instead, HauteBot focuses on ideas, references, and conversation. All powered by <b>publicly available data</b>, including fashion pieces from the <b>Metropolitan Museum of Art’s open-access repository</b>
                <br>
                We built this tool because we believe design shouldn’t feel like a dead-end when inspiration runs low. It should feel like a dialogue — and now, it can.
